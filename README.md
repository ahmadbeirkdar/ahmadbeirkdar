## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

Hey there! I am Ahmad, based in Toronto, Canada. 
I have a love for academia, books, and history. I also adore coffee! Anything from espressos, cortado to siphon coffee.
I am currently a Computer Engineering Major, and a Computer Science Minor.

I have a love and passion for Modern C++. I also love compilers, operating systems, and cryptography.
