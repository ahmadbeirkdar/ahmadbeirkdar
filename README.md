## 👋 🫶🏻 Hi there 
Hey there! I am Ahmad!

I am a Syrian Canadian.

I am pretty boring overall, I just like C++ & Rust. 

I do fun stuff, atleast fun to me, 99% of them are projects I can't have public.

Diversity & Inclusion is something important to me. 

I was blessed enough to work at cool places and cool teams. Currently @ LinkedIn in the Cryptography team.

My work is split up 50 50, half goes to my work work, the other to a project I've been working on for about 3 years at this point.

It's in educational tech, I pour my soul & tears towards it. I love it. I don't get to talk much about it. 

Anyways, feel free to reach out. I always like meeting new people 🫶🏻
