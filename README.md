### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I am Ahmad, based in Toronto, Canada. I have a love for academia, books, and history. I also adore coffee! Anything from espressos, cortado to siphon coffee. I am currently a Computer Engineering Major, and a Computer Science Minor. I know/love C++, Rust and Python.

Saying that, I also know C, Lua, and PHP, but I work more in C++ and Python.
